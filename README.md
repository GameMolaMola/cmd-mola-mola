   ```sh
   npm install
   # or pnpm install
   ```
2. Start the development server
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Run the test suite
   ```sh

   ```

## Mobile Builds

Guides for packaging the game for iOS and Android are available in the project source under `src/pages/AndroidGuide.tsx` and `src/pages/AppStoreGuide.tsx`.
